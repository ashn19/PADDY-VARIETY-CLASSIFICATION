### ðŸ“• PADDY VARIETY CLASSIFICATION
- Rice is a popular staple diet all over india and its demand has been
increasing in recent times. It is crucial to differentiate between types of rice grains to
prevent fraudulent labeling during import and export. To achieve this, a dataset
comprising of 12 varieties of rice, including ADT 37, Amman ,Andha BPT, Eramalli, IR 20, Karuppu Kavuni, Keerthi, MTU 1010, MTU 1290, Narmadha, Pacha Ponni, and Sonna Masur, which are mostly cultivated in Thanjavur, was collected. Each of
the rice seed obtained were categorically split into 1-seeded, 5-seeded, 10-seeded, 15-seeded, and 20-seeded images at different angles. A model using convolutional
neural networks(CNN) consisting of 25 layers was developed for classifying the rice
seed. The proposed model achieved a classification rate (70.8%) for each type of
Thanjavur-grown rice seeds, according to the experiments conducted.

### ðŸ“• METHODOLOGY
The research team used a 50-megapixel mobile camera to capture images of 12 different types of rice seeds commonly
grown in Thanjavur. The images were taken during the afternoon and evening under
natural lighting conditions. The rice seeds included ADT 37, Amman, Andha BPT, Eramalli, IR 20, Karuppu Kavuni, Keerthi, MTU 1010, MTU 1290, Narmadha, Pacha
Ponni, and Sonna Masur. For each type of rice seed, the team collected images of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 seeds for use in their experiments.The images were taken from 8 different angles. The camera will be mounted at
different angles, including 0, 40 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 140 , and 180 , to ensure a comprehensive view of each seed. This approach will enable the team to obtain detailed and accurate images of the seeds from multiple angles, which can aid in their analysis and identification. The research team collected 160
images for each of the 12 rice seed types, resulting in a total of 1920 images of seeded rice.
